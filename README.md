## 📁 Output Format

The results will be saved as a JSON file:

```json
{
  "https://www.virgio.com/": [
    "https://www.virgio.com/products/summer-floral-top",
    ...
  ],
  "https://www.tatacliq.com/": [
    "https://www.tatacliq.com/levis-blue-jeans/p-mp000000123456789",
    ...
  ]
}
```

- Run in a clean terminal (VS Code terminal or standalone) to avoid event loop conflicts.
